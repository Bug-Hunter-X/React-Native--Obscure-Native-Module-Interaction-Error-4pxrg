# React Native: Obscure Native Module Interaction Error

This repository demonstrates a difficult-to-debug issue involving a mismatch between a React Native wrapper and its underlying native module.  The native module might throw an error that isn't easily understood from the JavaScript side.

## Problem

When interacting with native modules in React Native, it's easy to encounter errors that originate in the native (Objective-C/Java/Swift) code but manifest as vague or unhelpful errors in the JavaScript environment.  The provided example illustrates such a situation, where a mismatch in data types or method calls leads to an unexpected failure.

## Solution

Debugging this kind of error requires carefully examining both the React Native code and the native module implementation.  Using logging on both sides can help pinpoint the source of the problem.  A well-structured native module with appropriate error handling and a React Native wrapper with robust input validation can significantly reduce the chance of these errors occurring.
