To resolve this issue, you need to examine both the React Native code and the native module implementation. You should use logging in both places to diagnose the exact point of failure. 

1. **React Native Side Debugging:** Ensure you are providing the correct input data types to the native module. Add console.log statements to verify what data you're passing to check if the input is correctly formatted.

```javascript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

const data = { correct: 123 }; // Correct data type
console.log('Sending data:', data); // Log the data to check
MyNativeModule.someMethod(data); 
```

2. **Native Module Side Debugging:** This requires accessing and modifying the native code (Objective-C, Java, or Swift, depending on your platform). Add logs to your native module to see the input data it receives. This allows for better error isolation.  Example (Illustrative, the specific implementation depends on your native language):

```objectivec
// Example Objective-C (iOS)
- (void)someMethod:(NSDictionary *)data {
  NSLog("Received data: %@", data);
  // ... your native module logic
}
```

3. **Improve Error Handling:** On the native side, add more robust error handling. Instead of just crashing, try to gracefully catch errors and return useful error messages back to the React Native side. 

4. **Input Validation:** Implement better input validation on the React Native side to prevent sending invalid data to the native module. You might need type checking or other validation strategies to ensure data integrity before passing it to the native module.
