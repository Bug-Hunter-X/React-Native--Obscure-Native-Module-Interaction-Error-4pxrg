This error occurs when you are using a library that relies on native modules and there's a mismatch between the native module's implementation and the way it's being used in your React Native code.  For example, if the native module expects a specific data type and your React Native code is providing a different one, or if there's an issue with method calls or event handling.  Often the error message from the native side might not be very helpful, making debugging difficult.

Example (Illustrative, as the exact error varies greatly depending on the native module):

```javascript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

MyNativeModule.someMethod({ invalid: 'data' }); // Incorrect data type
```

The native module might expect an integer and not an object, for instance.
